2. REPORT DETAILS
-----------------
TIMING-17#1 Critical Warning
Non-clocked sequential cell  
The clock pin pl_design_i/zynq_ultra_ps_e_0/inst/PS8_i/EMIOSPI0SCLKI is not reached by a timing clock
Related violations: <none>

CKLD-2#1 Warning
Clock Net has IO Driver, not a Clock Buf, and/or non-Clock loads  
Clock net SPI_0_0_sck_iobuf/O is directly driven by an IO rather than a Clock Buffer or may be an IO driving a mix of Clock Buffer and non-Clock loads. This connectivity should be reviewed and corrected as appropriate. Driver(s): SPI_0_0_sck_iobuf/IO
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-18#1 Warning
Missing input or output delay  
An input delay is missing on led_uf_tri_io[0] relative to the rising and/or falling clock edge(s) of clk_pl_0.
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-18#2 Warning
Missing input or output delay  
An input delay is missing on led_uf_tri_io[1] relative to the rising and/or falling clock edge(s) of clk_pl_0.
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-18#3 Warning
Missing input or output delay  
An input delay is missing on rpi_tri_io[0] relative to the rising and/or falling clock edge(s) of clk_pl_0.
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-18#4 Warning
Missing input or output delay  
An output delay is missing on led_uf_tri_io[0] relative to the rising and/or falling clock edge(s) of clk_pl_0.
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-18#5 Warning
Missing input or output delay  
An output delay is missing on led_uf_tri_io[1] relative to the rising and/or falling clock edge(s) of clk_pl_0.
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-18#6 Warning
Missing input or output delay  
An output delay is missing on rpi_tri_io[0] relative to the rising and/or falling clock edge(s) of clk_pl_0.
Related violations: <none>
